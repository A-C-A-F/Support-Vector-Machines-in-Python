# Support-Vector-Machines-in-Python


In this lesson we will built this __Support Vector Machine__ for classification using __scikit-learn__ and the __Radial Basis Function (RBF) Kernel__. Our training data set contains continuous and categorical data from the **[UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)** to predict whether or not a patient has **[heart disease](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Heart+Disease)**.


### Below are the key objectives of this project:
1.	Importing data into, and manipulating a pandas dataframe.
2.	Identifying and dealing with missing data.
3.	Formatting the data for a support vector machine, including One-Hot Encoding
4.	Optimizing parameters for the radial basis function and classification
5.	Building, evaluating, drawing and interpreting a support vector machine

### Below is the summary of the tasks performed in this project:
- __Task 1:__ Import the modules that will do all the work
- __Task 2:__ Import the data
- __Task 3:__ Missing Data Part 1: Identifying Missing Data
- __Task 4:__ Missing Data Part 2: Dealing With Missing Data
- __Task 5:__ Format Data Part 1: Split the Data into Dependent and Independent Variables
- __Task 6:__ Format the Data Part 2: One-Hot Encoding
- __Task 7:__ Format the Data Part 3: Centering and Scaling
- __Task 8:__ Build A Preliminary Support Vector Machine
- __Task 9:__ Optimize Parameters with Cross Validation
- __Task 10:__ Building, Evaluating, Drawing, and Interpreting the Final Support Vector Machine
